<h3>About Black Market Brawlers</h3>
Black Market Brawlers Analytics is a web application we submitted as an entry to the RIOT Games API 2.0 Challenge. Black Market Brawlers Analytic is about the performance of champions, items, teams, and players in Black Market Brawlers. 

The web application has two parts. For the first part, we create a graph application for summarizing the highest and lowest performance of champions(like. most damage dealt to champion) We also create the statistics tables for minion, teams, and gameplay. For the second part, we create a statistic table and items for each champions. We hope our data can help the players to analyze Black Market Brawlers

For front-end, we chose jQuery, bootstrap, and material design. But we ran out of time. We tried our best to build the front-end. For back-end, we chose express and node
